This is a very confusing subject and it is taking me some time to learn it, but I think that I am starting to get the hang of it now. I know that it is difficult to explain, but when I know the process it is quite simple and self explanatory.

I am hoping that as I go on, the subject get more complex, but my ability to understand and apprehend them grows. That is how I will get better at the things I already know, and how I will be able to learn bigger and more complex things just as easily. This is one of those things that seemed very complicated to start with, but now seems much more simple.
