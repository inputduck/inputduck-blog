I made a couple of different programs today in Javascript that used concatenation (sticking two things together) and maths operators. The final product was a tip calculator that showed the final amount and the tip amount in a popup alert. I was really pleased with it (consider that I had to ask for help from my partner on how to do the actual maths of working out a tip). I also used the .fixed(2) method to show the results to two decimal places.

As far as making a procedural function for the extension task I am a bit baffled. I am hoping that as we move further into Javascript I will properly understand what procedural functions are and how to use and make them.
